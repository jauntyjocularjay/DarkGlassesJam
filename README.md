# Dark Glasses Design Document

## Introduction

The idea for this game was bourn out of a post in which I vented my spleen when somebody mentioned their loved one "showed no signs" they would eventually take their own life. When we say somebody "showed no signs", we are letting people off the hook. Not you, dear reader. If you lost somebody this way, you are a victim as I see it. Still, there are **_always_** signs.

The problem is, depressed people are taught not to show signs. Long sleeves in summer. A razor blade tucked away in the desk. Crying alone in their room. Somewhere along the way, the person was taught they needed to hide the signs. It might have been a parent, a teacher, a bully, a friend, a grandfather, or just a misinterpreted scene in a movie. For me it was my mother and my friend "K". 

There is no chance to debrief, to contextualize, or to vent. I am sure they didn't even realize what they did. I tried to talk to my mom about the thoughts I had. She absolutely flipped out. Angry at me, the elementry school kid who realized life isn't actually worth living. It made an impression. My friend, tired of listening to me go on and on about how hopeless and powerless I was to the point that she told me that she had enough of hearing about it. The irony is: she is also a depressive. The condition is so bad that even those who suffer from it cannot stand to be exposed to these thoughts. 

Dark Glasses is born out of this recognition.

## Goal

Dark Glasses is going to use the Visual Novel format to tell a story that puts the player in the point of view of a suicide in waiting. This is to dispell, for those who play it, the notion of "no signs" of an upcoming suicide.

## Setting

We find Thomas living a relatively normal life and witness interpersonal relationships: good, bad, and ugly. He is not 'right', whatever that might mean in this context. The right or wrongness of his decision is not up for discussion. The question is "were there signs?"

## Mechanics

definition:

> game mechanics are "systems of interactions between the player and the game

The game is going to be set up as a web page with web-page navigation. There will be a psuedo conversation tree, but there is no actual way to change to the outcome without cheating. Some elements of the tree that might lead to a happy ending will be grayed out. Even then, averting the otherwise inevitable may not be possible down certain paths.

Cheat codes will be enterable in some form to unlock. Possibly by entering text into the notebook at the end of the first day.

The User Interface will reflect the mood variable in the game, from a scale of 0-12. As the mood variable decrements, the background will get darker and the elements will adjust accordingly for readability. The intent is for this to an indicator the player is not explicitly told they have. They need to either figure it out or look into the code. 

The code of the game is not going to be hidden or protected in any way. The game is DRM-free, and although UNLICENSED, people will still be able to look at the code. The tools I will use will be open source for anybody to use. This is something knowledgable players can use to have a better understanding of how the mechanics work, a bit like treating the visual novel as a thought experiment they can run over and over again. A black box recording of possibilities.








As the story progresses, we witness the deterioration of hope until he inevitably takes his own life.
